## Setup & Configuration

### Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install one_ring_sdk
```

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The OneRingSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```py
OneRingSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_access_token("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from one_ring_sdk import OneRingSdk

sdk = OneRingSdk(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from one_ring_sdk import OneRingSdk
from one_ring_sdk.models import GetBooksSort, Order

sdk = OneRingSdk(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.book.get_books(
    page=9,
    limit=245,
    offset=9,
    sort="id",
    order="asc",
    _id="_id",
    name="name"
)

print(result)

```

# Async Usage

The SDK includes an Async Client for making asynchronous API requests. This is useful for applications that need non-blocking operations, like web servers or apps with a graphical user interface.

```py
import asyncio
from one_ring_sdk import OneRingSdkAsync
from one_ring_sdk.models import GetBooksSort, Order

sdk = OneRingSdkAsync(
    access_token="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    timeout=10000
)


async def main():
  result = await sdk.book.get_books(
    page=9,
    limit=245,
    offset=9,
    sort="id",
    order="asc",
    _id="_id",
    name="name"
)
  print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
